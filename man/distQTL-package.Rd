\title{distQTL: Distribution-based eQTL mapping for scRNA-seq data}
\description{
This package conducts expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets, using donor level gene expression distributions as the target responses. Inference is conducted with Fr√©chet regression on 2-Wasserstein space, utilizing asymptotic partial F tests developed for this context.
