## Description
distQTL is a package for applying **dist**ribution-based **Q**uantitative **T**rait **L**ocus mapping using single-cell RNA sequence data.  distQTL takes cell-level expression data and SNP genotype data, and applies Fr√©chet regression for distribution responses with corresponding partial F-test inference methods.  This allows QTL mapping and characterization of distribution-wide effects.  distQTL sidesteps the donor level cell-cell correlation issue in single-cell RNA sequence data, and obtains fast and numerically stable inference results.  Unlike mixed effects approaches which fit a random intercept per donor, distQTL computation burden scales linearly with number of donors, and does not suffer convergence issues.
